The `panasonic_viera` platform allows you to control a Panasonic Viera TV.

## Configuration

To configure your Panasonic Viera TV, head to the **Configuration > Integrations** page. Click on the plus (+) button to add a new integration.

Once the integration is loaded, with your TV turned on and connected to your local network, enter the IP address of your TV and a name of your choice.

If your TV needs to be paired, you will be prompted to type the PIN code that will be displayed on it.

To allow your TV to be turned on or controlled while off, enable `Powered On By Apps` in the TV Settings: **Network > TV Remote App Settings**

## Manual configuration

If you prefer to use YAML to set up your Panasonic Viera TV, you can still do it. It also allows for some extra settings.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
panasonic_viera:
  host: YOUR_TV_IP
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your Panasonic Viera TV, e.g., `192.168.1.10`.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name you would like to give to the TV entity.
  required: false
  default: Panasonic Viera TV
  type: string
port:
  description: The port number of your Panasonic Viera TV.
  required: false
  default: 55000
  type: integer
turn_on_action:
  description: Defines an action to turn the TV on. If not specified, a power key signal will try to be sent to the TV. Be aware that it might not work properly with some models.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

When you restart Home Assistant, make sure the TV is turned on and connected to your local network. If your TV needs to be paired, you'll need to go to **Configuration > Integrations** to type the PIN code that will be displayed on it and finish the setup.

### Example `turn_on_action`

```yaml
# Example turn_on_action configuration.yaml entry with Wake-on-LAN
panasonic_viera:
  host: YOUR_TV_IP
  name: Living Room TV
  turn_on_action:
    - service: wake_on_lan.send_magic_packet
      data:
        mac: "AA:BB:CC:DD:99:1A"
```

### Example `play_media` script

The `play_media` function can be used to open web pages and other media types (images, movies) via URLs in the TV web browser.

```yaml
# Example play_media script
script:
  front_door_camera:
    alias: "Show who's at the door"
    sequence:
      - service: media_player.turn_on
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
      - service: media_player.play_media
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
          media_content_type: "url"
          media_content_id: YOUR_URL
      - delay:
        seconds: 5
      - service: media_player.media_stop
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
```
